** Overview

*** Introducing nodes

The development for Amusewiki 2.4 started in the late spring 2019
developing a new feature, the "nodes", to overcome the limitation of
the single level author/topic structure and to gain the ability to
build arbitrary trees of texts.

Sometimes this approach can be better than having the category
hardcoded into the text, but it's your choice. You can use this or the
classical system, or both.

The feature is still marked as experimental, but it can be accessed under
[[/node]]

A quick demo would probably give you a better idea of what is about.

*** Binary uploads

The support for attached files has been extended. You can now upload
audio and video files (you will probably need to tweak the max upload
size in the admin) and create pages to display them without the
infobox.

Example source:

{{{
#ATTACH t-t-test-1.webm t-t-test-2.pdf t-t-test-4.mp3 t-t-test-3.mp4
#title File Gallery
#blob 1
}}}

Resulting in such page:

*** Express publishing

A new option has been added in the admin, "Speed up the publishing
process", which will skip the revision page if you have the permission
to publish and there are no conflicts. Also when the publishing is
complete, you will be redirected automatically to the target page.

This makes sense if you are the only one working on the site and the
publishing procedure seems too long and kind of gratuitous (it's not,
really!) to you.


*** Let's Encrypt

The version 1 of the ACME protocol is going away soon, so Amusewiki is
now using the version 2, thanks to
[[https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::ACME2][=Net::ACME2=]]. Unofficial
Debian packages are available for Stretch and Buster at
[[https://packages.amusewiki.org/][packages.amusewiki.org]]

** Changes

*** 2.400 2019-10-27

 - Upgraded RU localization
 - Improved express publishing

*** 2.392 2019-08-23

 - Upgraded HR and IT localization

*** 2.391 2019-08-15

 - Migrate from =Protocol::ACME= to =Net::ACME2= to get Let's Encrypt
   certificate using the new protocol, given that the old one is
   getting sinked soon.
 - New site option: express_publishing. If in effect, the publishing
   procedure is speeded up and if no conflict is found, the text will
   be published right away. This is useful if there are no external
   contributions.
 - Add List-Id to our mails, so clients have a chance to pick it up.
 - Support per-format template files via newest Text::Amuse::Compile

*** 2.390 2019-07-25

 - Added experimental node system. It's accessible to logged in users
   under =/node=. The basic functionality is there. Probably needs
   refinement with locale-aware sorting. This permits to create
   arbitrary category trees.
 - Added experimental feature for adding binary files like
   video/audio. Available in the configuration panel.
