*A·Muse·Wiki* (also spelled Amusewiki or amusewiki) is a
library-oriented wiki engine and publishing platform. It can work as a
read-only site, as a moderated wiki, or as a fully open wiki.

It strives to be simple and yet powerful enough for long-term
archiving of texts.

Full support for high-quality printing of the texts is one of the core
features.

*** Features

 - User-friendly markup borrowed from [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs-muse/index.html][Emacs Muse]]
 - **Importing of HTML** documents preserving most of the logical markup
 - Wide range of output formats, including high-quality **PDF** (via LaTeX) and **EPUB**
 - Automatic generation of PDF for **printing**, including **imposition** and **crop marks**
 - **Collection** creation and PDF reformatting, with plenty of layout options
 - Production of **slides**
 - Texts are stored under revision control with **Git**
 - Offline editing via Git
 - Fast and accurate **full-text search** (with many available options)
 - **Multisite** engine: on one instance you can run as many sites you want
 - Embedded [[/opds][OPDS server]]
 - Mail notifications
 - RSS feed
 - Localization via gettext (depending on the language, the coverage varies from complete to zero, but it's easy to add).
 - Multilanguage on the same site is supported
 - Syntax highlight via [[https://highlightjs.org/][highlight.js]]
 - Automatic db upgrades
 - [[http://packages.amusewiki.org][Packaged for debian]] with batteries included

*** Missing features (so far)

 - no talks, comments, etc.
 - no refined access control (only basic)

Every wiki has a sandbox, so [[http://sandbox.amusewiki.org][here it is]].

The code is written in Perl and is freely available (under the same
terms as Perl itself) on [[https://github.com/melmothx/amusewiki/releases][github]].

*** Codebase

Beside the wiki engine itself, some perl modules were developed for
this project and are available on CPAN.
