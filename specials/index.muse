This is the homepage for [[/special/about][amusewiki]], a
library-oriented wiki engine. Amusewiki is more than just a wiki
engine, it’s also a powerful authoring, archiving and publishing
platform.

** Getting started

Amusewiki is 100% free software. You can download it at
[[https://github.com/melmothx/amusewiki/releases][github]] (make sure to follow
the [[/library/install][**installation instructions**]])
or save time, energy and troubles and install it on Debian/Ubuntu with
the (unofficial) packages provided at
[[http://packages.amusewiki.org][packages.amusewiki.org]], which are regularly updated at each release.

Amusewiki is based on the
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs-muse/][Emacs Muse]] markup,
remaining mostly compatible with the original implementation. A
detailed [[/library/manual][**markup manual**]] is provided.

This site runs on amusewiki itself. If you want to try out the editing
and publishing process, you can use the
[[https://sandbox.amusewiki.org][sandbox]]

If you need help, you’re welcome to drop to the
[[https://amusewiki.org/help/irc][IRC channel]].

** Features

Amusewiki was created to manage and edit large amounts of texts (books
and articles) with a special focus on quality, printing and first rate
reading experience. See [[/library/rationale]] to understand its
architecture.

Core features:

 - **high-quality output** ([[/special/index.epub][**EPUB**]] and [[/special/index.pdf][**PDF with LaTeX quality**]]).
 - flat-file and [[/git][**Git** backend]] for long-term archiving.
 - the [[/library/bookbuilder-tutorial][**bookbuilder**]]
 - [[/help/opds][**OPDS** server]] for mobile users to deliver the texts straight into the reading apps

[[/special/about][See the feature list for more details.]]
