** OPDS

 - Open Publication Distribution System [[http://opds-spec.org/]]
 - Atom feed with navigation and acquisition entries
 - Supported by most EPUB Android readers (FBreader, Aldiko, Moon+ reader)
 - Deliver the texts straight into the applications
 - Module [[https://metacpan.org/pod/XML::OPDS][=XML::OPDS=]]
 - Example and help: [[https://amusewiki.org/help/opds]]
 - Transparent pagination to save bandwidth
 - HTTP authorization supported for private sites
 - Full text-search supported

** OPDS example

** Blog mode

 - Optional feature which can be activated in the admin console
 - time-based sorting
 - teasers
 - decorative images
 - tag cloud (accessible via ajax)
 - monthly archives (accessible via ajax)
 - form free layout elements (gives a chance to the admin to fully
   customize the site, in addition to local JS and CSS)
 - bootswatch theme selection [[https://bootswatch.com/]]

** Blog example

** Other notable improvements

 - SSL made free and automatic with Let's Encrypt and [[https://metacpan.org/pod/Protocol::ACME][Protocol::ACME]]
 - Code highlight with [[https://highlightjs.org/][highlight.js]]
 - Automatic DB upgrades with [[https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler][DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler]]
 - Fine tune logging with [[https://metacpan.org/pod/Log::Log4perl][Log::Log4perl]] and [[https://metacpan.org/pod/Log::Contextual][Log::Contextual]]
 - Documentation on [[https://amusewiki.org]]

** Debian packages

Instead of running the app from the git tree on a dedicated home, with
a =local::lib= tree or with a perl installed in the home, now you can
visit [[http://packages.amusewiki.org/]] and follow the instructions
there (import the key, add the repository, and install the package).

Minimum requirement: Debian Jessie and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

** Debian packages cons

 - More burden on the developer
 - Trivial changes require a package rebuild
 - Needs to ship about 25 new packages (fonts and perl modules)
 - Can't use fresh code from the module used (e.g., newer Catalyst) without being too invasive.
 - Debian people usually don't like private repositories

** Debian packages pros

 - Installation is straightforward
 - Maintenance for the administrator is integrated in the regular apt-get routine   
 - Much smaller installation footprint (mostly because the texlive
   installation is optimized and shared)
 - Improved security
    - code is installed and owned by root, not by the user running the application
    - debian is taking care of the security updates of the
      dependencies (not only the perl dependencies, but also the
      libraries used by LaTeX, cgit and other utilities)
 - 0 downtime upgrades out of the box
 - Predictability of locations and module versions (so gets more live testing)
